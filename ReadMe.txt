1:
BlackJackGame.Java (This holds all the games logic and stores the 2 
Arrays for the game)

BlackJackGUI.Java (This holds the code to create the GUI. it also
imports the methods from the BlackJackGame class)

RunGame.Java (Stores the public static void main() in order to
run and display the game in GUI fashion)

2:
the core functionality would definitely be the GUI as it displays the game. it gives the player 3 buttons to which
they can click and interact with it. another core functionality would be the ArrayList since the stores the cards in number form
the reason there are two is that when a card is picked and given to the player or dealer
that card gets deleted. and when a new game is clicked. that array that we are using copies the array
that has nothing removed. so one array is just a template and the other array is what we are using for the game

3:
the color for the GUI would be an optional functionality. since there was no need for any colors. But I decided
to make a personal pick for the color and give it a look that a regular table would look In a casino. the layout for the
GUI was also optional, I chose the BorderLayout since I will only be using 3 buttons

I would've added money into the game so that you would start with 1,000 euros and you bet  1 or 5 or 10
or 20 or 50. It would be cool but then again gambling isn't a good habit, although if you're not losing real cash then
there aren't any real harsh consequences.
